# Alerts for failures nothing else reports. The kg-graph handler catches query failures and returns
# them to the agent, so Lambda's own Errors metric stays 0 and Gateway reports isError: false. Only
# the status field in the handler's log line shows them, so a metric filter reads that line.
# A filter also avoids PutMetricData, which the Lambdas could not reach: their VPC has no route to it.

# The kg-graph log group is already managed as aws_cloudwatch_log_group.loader_lambda
# (terraform/loader_lambda.tf), imported there after Lambda auto-created it on first run.
