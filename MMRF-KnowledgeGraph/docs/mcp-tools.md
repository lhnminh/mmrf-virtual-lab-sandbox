# Knowledge graph MCP tools

For agents that use the multiple myeloma knowledge graph. There are nine read-only tools behind one AgentCore Gateway. The envelope they return is defined in [AD-004](adrs/0004-integration-seam-tool-contract-and-response-types.md).

## Connect

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **URL** | `https://mmrf-kg-gateway-hjyd9sqogd.gateway.bedrock-agentcore.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mcp` (also `terraform output gateway_url`) |
| **Protocol** | MCP over HTTPS. After `initialize`, send the `MCP-Protocol-Version` header with the version it returned, or the Gateway answers HTTP 400. MCP client libraries normally do this for you. |
| **Auth** | AWS SigV4, signing service `bedrock-agentcore`, region `us-west-2` |
| **IAM permission** | `bedrock-agentcore:InvokeGateway` on `arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-west-2:548574235556:gateway/mmrf-kg-gateway-hjyd9sqogd` |

Your agent needs no VPC access. Keep the URL in configuration, because recreating the Gateway changes it. Calls have only been tested from within account `548574235556`.

To check your access, run this with your own credentials. It lists the tools and makes one call:

```sh
uv run python scripts/test_gateway.py --gateway-url <URL>
```

## Tools

Over MCP, every name has the target prefix: `kg-graph___kg_search_entities`, and so on.

| Tool | Use it to | Arguments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kg_search_entities` | Turn a plain-language term into a graph id. Finds diseases, phenotypes, genes, drugs and mechanisms. Start here. | `text` (required): a name fragment or exact id, such as a drug name or `CHEBI:75998`. `limit`: 1-200, default 20. |
| `kg_get_phenotypes` | List the phenotypes recorded for a disease (Monarch and DisMech). A phenotype in both has one edge per source. | `disease_id` (required), such as `MONDO:0009693`. `limit`: 1-200, default 50. |
| `kg_get_mechanism_paths` | Get DisMech mechanisms and the causal edges between them, with evidence. | `disease_id` (required). |
| `kg_get_evidence` | Look up the evidence for one edge, or every edge citing a reference. | Exactly one of `edge_id` (from `graph.edges[].id`) or `reference` (such as `PMID:34201396` or `infores:orphanet`). |
| `kg_get_gene_context` | See everything recorded about one human gene, per source: Monarch gene-disease associations, DisMech genetic factors, the subtypes the gene defines, and the drugs that act on it (Open Targets). Says "none recorded" for Monarch or DisMech when a source has nothing. | `gene` (required): an HGNC id such as `HGNC:6407` or an approved symbol such as `KRAS`. `limit`: 1-200, default 50. |
| `kg_get_gene_disease_association` | Get the link between one gene and one disease from each source: the Monarch association (relationship, knowledge source, disease id), the DisMech genetic factor and the subtype the gene defines. With a `variant`, says whether anything exists at that specificity. | `gene` and `disease_id` (both required). `variant`: optional, such as `KRAS G12D`. |
| `kg_get_treatment_evidence` | Get a disease's recorded treatments with their agents, the mechanism each acts on (with that link's evidence and the mechanism's place in the disease record), and the cited evidence text. Also returns each agent's molecular targets from Open Targets (up to 10 per agent) and lists treatments with no mechanism link and agents with no recorded target. | `disease_id` (required). `treatment`, `mechanism`: optional name filters, such as `trametinib` or `RAS/MAPK`. |
| `kg_get_drug_context` | Everything recorded about one drug: its gene targets (Open Targets), the treatments it is an agent of, and the diseases those treat. Start here for a drug question. | `drug` (required): a name such as `trametinib`, or a `CHEBI`/`CHEMBL`/`NCIT` id. `limit`: 1-200, default 50. |
| `kg_run_readonly_query` | Ask something no named tool covers. Use this last. | `query` (required): one openCypher read. `parameters`: values for `$name` placeholders. |

### Limits on `kg_run_readonly_query`

- One statement of at most 4,000 characters, and it must `RETURN`.
- No `CREATE`, `MERGE`, `DELETE`, `DETACH`, `SET`, `REMOVE`, `DROP`, `FOREACH`, `CALL`, `LOAD CSV` or `USING PERIODIC`.
- Variable-length paths need an upper bound of at most 5 hops, such as `[:LEADS_TO*1..3]`.
- Results stop at 100 rows.
- Rows carry provenance only if your query returns those properties.

## Read the response

Each result's `content[0].text` is a JSON string holding this envelope:

```json
{
  "contract_version": "0.2",
  "result_type": "graph",
  "summary": "DisMech records 8 mechanisms and 7 causal edges for Multiple Myeloma (MONDO:0009693).",
  "observations": [{ "text": "DisMech records that A leads to B.", "refs": ["<evidence id>"] }],
  "interpretation": [{ "text": "<curator commentary>", "basis": "source_curator_commentary", "refs": ["<evidence id>"] }],
  "graph": {
    "nodes": [{ "id": "dismech:mechanism:MONDO:0009693:A", "label": "A", "type": "Mechanism", "source_dataset": "dismech", "source_version": "<commit>" }],
    "edges": [{ "id": "dismech:dismech:mechanism:MONDO:0009693:A|leads_to|dismech:mechanism:MONDO:0009693:B", "source": "dismech:mechanism:MONDO:0009693:A", "target": "dismech:mechanism:MONDO:0009693:B", "predicate": "leads_to",
                "edge_origin": "recorded", "source_dataset": "dismech", "source_version": "<commit>", "evidence_ids": ["<evidence id>"] }],
    "paths": [{ "node_ids": ["<node id>", "<node id>", "<node id>"], "edge_ids": ["<edge id>", "<edge id>"] }]
  },
  "evidence": [{ "id": "<evidence id>", "reference": "PMID:34201396", "snippet": "<quoted text>", "source_dataset": "dismech", "source_version": "<commit>" }],
  "query": { "language": "openCypher", "text": "<the query that ran>", "parameters": {} },
  "limitations": ["Only the first evidence item of each DisMech causal edge is loaded into the graph."],
  "trace": { "request_id": "<id>", "plan": [], "tool_calls": [{ "tool": "kg_get_mechanism_paths", "inputs": {} }] }
}
```

`kg_run_readonly_query` returns `result_type: "table"` with an added `table: { "columns": [], "rows": [] }`. Rejected input and failures return `result_type: "text"`.

### Draw the graph from `graph`

Every tool fills `graph` the same way, so one renderer works for all of them: `nodes`, `edges` (each `source` and `target` is a node `id`) and `paths`.

`paths` lists ordered chains of the returned edges. In each path, `node_ids[i]` and `node_ids[i + 1]` are joined by `edge_ids[i]`, following the edge direction.

- Named tools: only three build paths, because only they return results that form chains. A path is a longest chain of two or more returned edges that never visits a node twice. The other tools (`kg_search_entities`, `kg_get_phenotypes`, `kg_get_evidence`, `kg_get_gene_context`) always return `"paths": []`, so use `edges`. A result with no chain also has `"paths": []`.
  - `kg_get_mechanism_paths`: chains start at a mechanism that nothing leads into.
  - `kg_get_treatment_evidence`: chains start at the disease (disease, treatment, agent, target gene; or disease, treatment, mechanism).
  - `kg_get_gene_disease_association`: chains start at the disease (disease, subtype, gene).

  At most 20 paths are listed, and `limitations` says when more exist. `edges` is always complete.
- `kg_run_readonly_query`: `graph` holds the nodes, relationships and paths that the query returned, using the same ids as the named tools. A path in `graph.paths` is a `MATCH p = ...` value that the query returned. A node or relationship needs an `id` property to appear, so return it whole (`RETURN a, r, b` or `RETURN p`), not as `a.name`. Scalar columns stay in `table`.

A path is a chain in the returned graph. It is not the order in which Neptune evaluated the query.

Every tool declares an `outputSchema` matching this shape, so a client that negotiates MCP protocol version `2025-06-18` or later should also get the envelope back as `structuredContent`, avoiding a second JSON parse of `content[0].text`. As of writing, the Gateway itself still negotiates protocol version `2025-03-26` (which predates `outputSchema`/`structuredContent`), so `structuredContent` isn't populated yet — only `content[0].text`. This should start working with no changes on our side once AgentCore Gateway updates its MCP protocol support.

### Rules for your agent

- **Don't rely on `isError`.** Rejected input and failed queries still report `isError: false`. Read `summary` and `limitations`.
- **Always pass on `limitations`.** They say what the answer can't support.
- **Keep the two kinds of statement apart.** `observations` are what a source record states. `interpretation` is explanation, and is not an established fact.
- **Say "none recorded", never "none exists".** An empty result only describes this graph.
- **Show your sources.** Each edge's `evidence_ids` point to `evidence`, and each edge has a `source_dataset` and `source_version`. See [how citations work](citations.md) for how a `refs` array gets built.
- **Don't give treatment recommendations.** Graph content is published knowledge. It isn't clinical advice and doesn't validate a synthetic Virtual Lab result.

## What the graph contains

172 nodes and 305 relationships for multiple myeloma (MM) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML, `MONDO:0011908`):

| Source | Version | Provides |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Monarch KG | `2026-10-07` | MM: 43 associations (phenotypes, related diseases and others). JMML: 5, including the gene-level KRAS association (`HGNC:6407`, Orphanet) |
| DisMech | `v0.1.46` (commit `b1ca0b232b815a21b4ba95a62828c9979e9a49e7`) | MM: 8 mechanisms, 7 causal edges, 9 phenotypes, 3 genetic factors, and 6 treatments with 11 named drugs. JMML: 5 mechanisms, 5 subtypes with their driver genes, 7 genetic factors, 3 treatments each linked to a mechanism |
| Open Targets | `26.09` | 144 drug-to-gene edges (`TARGETS_GENE`) for the 13 drug agents named in the DisMech treatments, with the FDA label or document that supports each. Not its gene-disease associations or other data |
| ClinicalTrials.gov / PubMed | Registry data timestamp `2026-11-04T10:00:04` | 8 registered studies (6 MM, 2 JMML), 8 disease-to-trial and 8 treatment-to-trial paths backed by structured PubMed registry accessions. Phase, status and enrollment are registry metadata, not efficacy findings. Use `kg_run_readonly_query`; see [trial queries and ingestion](clinical-trials.md). |

(:Mechanism)-[:LEADS_TO_PHENOTYPE {source, source_version, edge_origin, evidence_pmid, evidence_snippet, dismech_explanation}]->(:Entity {phenotype or outcome})   // a downstream step that is not itself a mechanism
```

On `ASSOCIATION`, Monarch edges use `primary_knowledge_source` and `publications`, and DisMech edges use the other citation properties. Filter on `source` to separate them. `publications` is a `;`-separated string. `dismech_explanation` and DisMech's `description` on a `Mechanism` or `ASSOCIATION` are curator commentary, so report them as interpretation.

**Not available yet:**

- CIViC data, and Open Targets beyond drug targets (its gene-disease associations and tractability), so there are no variant or target-prioritization answers. Genes are limited to what Monarch, DisMech and the drug targets name. For a drug's targets use `kg_get_drug_context`; for a gene's drugs use `kg_get_gene_context`.
- Variant-level records. Associations are at gene level, so `kg_get_gene_disease_association` reports a requested variant as a change in specificity.
- A drug target in the DisMech record itself. DisMech names targets such as MEK1/2 only in descriptions. The target edges come from Open Targets, so the tools present them as a separate source from the trial evidence. Proteasome inhibitors list every proteasome subunit (38 genes), so responses cap targets at 10 per agent.
- Trial results as structured data. Population and response appear only in the quoted evidence snippet.
- Only the loaded diseases are covered. Anything else is "none recorded" until it is loaded (`ingestion/fetch_*.py`, then the `sources` argument of `kg-ingest`).
- Seven retired `Mechanism` nodes (Anemia, Splenomegaly and others) that an earlier load made for JMML downstream steps that are really phenotypes. They have no `id` and are marked `retired`; no tool returns them. They count toward the node total because the loader cannot delete. Their real relationships are the `LEADS_TO_PHENOTYPE` edges.
- DisMech's cell types, biological processes and locations for each mechanism.
- Links between phenotypes and mechanisms for multiple myeloma. Anemia, for example, is a phenotype with no edge from Bone Marrow Failure. (DisMech's JMML record does record them, as `LEADS_TO_PHENOTYPE` edges.) `kg_get_mechanism_paths` lists every step its mechanism descriptions state without an edge in `limitations`, beginning `Not a recorded edge:`.

## Example: from a gene to a drug in JMML

1. `kg_get_gene_disease_association` with `{"gene": "KRAS", "disease_id": "MONDO:0011908", "variant": "KRAS G12D"}` returns the Monarch association between `HGNC:6407` and JMML (relationship `gene_associated_with_condition`, source `infores:orphanet`) and DisMech's KRAS-mutated subtype. `limitations` says the record is at gene level, not specific to the variant.
2. `kg_get_mechanism_paths` with `{"disease_id": "MONDO:0011908"}` returns the DisMech JMML mechanisms, including RAS/MAPK Pathway Hyperactivation.
3. `kg_get_treatment_evidence` with `{"disease_id": "MONDO:0011908", "treatment": "trametinib"}` returns trametinib, the mechanism it inhibits, the phase II trial text (PMID:38867349) in `evidence`, and its targets MAP2K1 and MAP2K2 from Open Targets with their FDA label references. `limitations` says the targets are not part of the DisMech record and the trial result is text only.

## Example: what leads to hypercalcemia?

1. `kg_search_entities` with `{"text": "myeloma"}` finds `MONDO:0009693`.
2. `kg_get_mechanism_paths` with `{"disease_id": "MONDO:0009693"}` returns the mechanisms, causal edges and evidence.
3. For a narrower question, use `kg_run_readonly_query`:

   ```json
   {
     "query": "MATCH (a:Mechanism)-[:LEADS_TO*1..2]->(b:Mechanism {name: $target}) RETURN a.name AS cause, b.name AS effect",
     "parameters": { "target": "Hypercalcemia" }
   }
   ```

   This returns Osteolytic Bone Disease and Clonal Plasma Cell Proliferation.

## Example: which treatments and drugs are recorded?

There is no named tool for this yet, so use `kg_run_readonly_query`. Change the predicate to `dismech:has_genetic_factor` and drop the `OPTIONAL MATCH` for genetic factors. Report these as recorded knowledge, not recommendations.

```json
{
  "query": "MATCH (:Disease {id: $id})-[r:ASSOCIATION {predicate: 'dismech:has_recorded_treatment'}]->(t) OPTIONAL MATCH (t)-[:HAS_AGENT]->(a) RETURN t.label AS treatment, r.evidence_pmid AS pmid, r.source_version AS version, collect(a.label) AS agents ORDER BY treatment",
  "parameters": { "id": "MONDO:0009693" }
}
```

To see one record's citation and curator commentary, call `kg_get_evidence` with `edge_id`, such as `dismech:MONDO:0009693|dismech:has_recorded_treatment|dismech:treatment:CAR-T Cell Therapy`.
